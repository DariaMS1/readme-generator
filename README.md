# README generator

## Description

The motivation of the project was to create a README generator for coders to easily generate their project's information. It fastens the writing of a README.
I built the project to develop my understanding of Node as well as modules and dependencies; dipping the toes into backend programming. 
I learned more about the usage of 'fs' and package installing, whilst also becoming more comfortable using the terminal. Developed understanding of modules and how to integrate them in code to create interactive command-line applications.

## Installation

Clone the repo and ensure you have the dependencies locally downloaded. Once in the repo (locally), run 'npm install' in the terminal.

## Usage

After completing the prompting stage, the README.md will be generated inside the 'results' folder.
